"""
You are given a string s. Return the array of unique characters, sorted by highest to lowest occurring characters.
If two or more characters have the same frequency, then arrange them in alphabetic order.

Example 1
Input : s = "tree"
Output : ['e', 'r', 't' ]
Explanation :
The occurrences of each character are as shown below :
e --> 2
r --> 1
t --> 1.
The r and t have same occurrences, so we arrange them by alphabetic order.

Example 2
Input : s = "raaaajj"
Output : ['a' , 'j', 'r' ]
Explanation :
The occurrences of each character are as shown below :
a --> 4
j --> 2
r --> 1
